            Welcome to Flow! Our vibrant and colorful hostel is located in the heart of the Amsterdam canals, just a
            short walk away from popular attractions. The Flow is a unique Amsterdam stay, as we are located on a
            boat; a boat which will be 100 years old this upcoming year. We have created a peaceful oasis that still
            offers you the benefits of being located in the center of the city.
